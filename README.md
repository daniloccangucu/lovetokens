## Architecture & Design

#### Folder Structure:

- **public:** Contains the single HTML file and icons directly served by the web server. This HTML file acts as the entry point for the React application, which then dynamically renders all components and content.    
-   **src:**
    -   **components:** Reusable UI components organized into folders such as affectionlist, appreciationatelier, headers, home, login, lovearchive, navbar, shared, and singlelovetoken.
    - **contexts:** Provides a React context provider for managing the global state of light and dark themes.
    -   **images:** Stores images used in the application.
	- **models:** Contains data models for categories, love tokens, users, and types used across the application.    	
	- **pages:** Houses page-level components for various application routes, including components for accessing the Appreciation Atelier, user authentication and authorization, user profile, Love Archive, Affection List management, and individual Love Token display.
	- **store:** Centralizes Redux-related files, incorporating React Tool Kit Query for efficient API interaction. Responsible for managing application state through reducers, actions, and integrated modules, covering features like the user's Affection List, authentication, Love Tokens, and notifications.
	- **styles:** Contains global stylesheets and styling variables. Utilizes SASS and Tailwind for styling purposes.    	
	- **tests:** Contains unit tests for store-related functionalities, including API interactions and Redux slices.
	- **utils:** Houses utility functions used across the application.
#### Data Flow:
Data flows in the application primarily through React Context API and Redux for global state management. Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query) handles asynchronous operations such as API calls. Actions are dispatched to Redux reducers, which update the store accordingly, and components subscribe to the relevant parts of the store to react to changes.

#### Component Structure:
The component structure of the application is briefly illustrated in the diagram below:

*Diagram made with [beautiful-react-diagrams](https://antonioru.github.io/beautiful-react-diagrams/)*

- **PageHeader:** Renders page titles and subtitles for various components.
- **DataLoader:** Manages data loading states for fetching information from APIs.
- **HeaderTwo:** Displays secondary headers within components.
- **NotificationBox:** Shows notifications and prompts for user actions.
- **Profile:** Represents the user's profile page, displaying user information.
- **Form:** Handles user input fields for actions like registration and login.
- **InputField1, InputField2, InputField3:** Represents input fields for username, email, and password.
- **Register:** Manages user registration functionality.
- **Login:** Handles user login functionality.
- **SingleLoveToken:** Displays detailed information about a single Love Token, including its content and categories.

## Testing:

The testing suite, comprising 6 test suites and 22 individual tests in total, evaluates the application's store functionalities. Tests for the Affection List API encompass operations like adding, fetching, and updating love tokens, ensuring effective management of Affection Lists. Similarly, LoveTokenApi tests features such as fetching, creating, and deleting love tokens, ensuring seamless store operations. AuthSlice and CategoriesSlice Reducer tests validate authentication status toggling and category list manipulation accuracy, fortifying the store's resilience and robustness. These tests represent a subset of comprehensive efforts to ensure store stability.

- **Libraries/Frameworks Used:** Jest is used as the testing framework along with React Testing Library for unit testing. The `react-scripts` package is utilized for running tests.

- **Running Tests:** Tests can be run using the following command:
  ```
  npm test
  ```

**Deployment:**

I deployed the project using Netlify and GitHub. By linking the GitHub repository to Netlify, the application automatically deploys whenever changes are pushed to the repository. The deployed result can be viewed at [lovetokens.netlify.app](https://lovetokens.netlify.app/).

### Backend API on AWS EC2:

Base URL: [https://13.49.67.88:3000](http://13.49.67.88:3000/)

I created a backend API on AWS EC2 using Node.js, Express, and Mongoose, implementing endpoints for Love Token management, user authentication, and Affection List management. SSL
